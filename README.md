# Rock Paper Scissors x99

## Project Overview

In this project, you will build all of the logic needed for a more intense version of
Rock Paper Scissors (RPS). Rather than selecting just one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors - each player
will select three moves. Each move will consist of a type (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) as well
as a strength value. Each player will have 99 total points to use as strength between all
three of their moves.
